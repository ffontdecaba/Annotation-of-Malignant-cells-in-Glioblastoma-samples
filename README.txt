# Analisis of Glioblastoma samples

## Scope

This analysis is my first analysis "on my own" and it is meant to be a practice of my skills with real data above all. I consider this analysis to be an interpretation as accurate as I can do. This is why sometimes i'll make mistakes, my pipeline will be ineficient or i wll be simply wrong about something that I say. I am getting better every moment that I spend doing this kind of analysis. Please if you find some of these mistakes, I would appriciate if you could point it out, I am always open to constructive criticism :).
